# amino-epg-grabber
A Python program to grab EPG data for KPN based IPTV in XMLTV format

AminoEPGGrabber(.py) is a program made for IPTV users that like to watch their IPTV on a HTPC.

It will connect to an IPTV VLAN that is set up for Amino IPTV boxes and grab the EPG data that is provided for them. This EPG data is then converted into XMLTV format so it can be used in most HTPC software.

The latest version of AminoEPGGrabber is v0.5 You can get it from the [releases folder](https://github.com/jbogers/amino-epg-grabber/tree/master/releases). Please read the [Installation] wiki page for installation instructions.

**IMPORTANT:** This program is only meant to provide EPG listings for IPTV users. While the EPG grabber is open source, the grabbed EPG data is not! *The EGP data belongs to your EPG provider and may not be redistributed.*
